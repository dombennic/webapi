We completed all the functions as stated in the project.
Added in functions as below:
- View Cart
- View History
The view cart and view history is the same thing because we do not have a checkout page after adding to cart. 
Hence everything that is inside the database collection is our cart and our order history at the same time

- Add and View Favourites (with only one favourite allowed per user)
